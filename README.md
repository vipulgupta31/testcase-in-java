# How to write a test case in Java?
This repository holds the beginner code for anyone who wants to understand and start writing test cases in Java.

## What is a test case?
A test case in software testing is a set of conditions or instructions that a tester follows/executes to ensure that the developed software product functions properly. Multiple test cases are used to evaluate how the software should work in normal, or error conditions.

A test case acts as a guide providing the exact steps, the data to be used, and the expected results. This helps the testers identify any defects or inconsistencies in the software early on.

## Assertions in test cases in Java
The assertion is the most important part of a test case other than its flow. Assertion in Selenium in simple language is a command used to perform some verification during or at the end of the flow. An assertion adds the required value to the test case as this is where our actual and expected results are verified and we get to know if we got the expected behaviour or result. 

There are 2 types of assertions : Hard and Soft
